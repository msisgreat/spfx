## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository

- Navigate to the file 'src/webparts/components/TermsPickerComponent.tsx'

- In the method "GetTerms", replace the <TERM_STORE_NAME> with the term store name in your tenant.

- Navigate to the file 'src/webparts/components/ReactTaxonomyPickerpanel.tsx'

- In the RENDER method of the webpart, a custom taxonomy picker component is used. Please replace the "TermSetId" property with the desired term set id in your tenant.

  - `npm install`
  - `gulp serve`

- Navigate to - <Your SP site>/_layouts/workbench.aspx and add the "react-taxonomypicker-panel"


## Features

- This webpart demonstrates the use of a custom taxonomy picker control built with Office UI Fabric React Panel and Tagpicker that enables users to select terms for a single-select or multi-select taxonomy field in a controlled manner.

- The custom taxonomy picker control is a reusable React component and can be easily placed in a SPFx webpart just by providing the TermSetId as a property to the component.

  <TermsPickerComponent IsMultiValue={false} TermSetId='<TERM-SET-ID>' LabelText='Single-select field' SelectedTerms={<State variable>}/>

- By supplying the "SelectedTerms" property, the control can also be used in scenarios where pre-filled choices are to be shown such as the Edit form of a list item etc.

- The selected terms can be supplied as an array of a custom object 

  {
    name : "<Term Name>",
    key : "<Term ID>"
  }
